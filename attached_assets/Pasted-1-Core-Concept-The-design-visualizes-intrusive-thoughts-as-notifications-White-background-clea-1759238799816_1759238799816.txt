1. Core Concept

The design visualizes intrusive thoughts as notifications.

White background = clean, clinical, neutral ‚Üí references mental health campaigns.

Notifications = chaotic, stacked, overlapping ‚Üí the ‚Äúnoise‚Äù of the mind.

Ghost text = faint, floating background phrases ‚Üí subconscious chatter.

2. Color & Style Guide
Background

Pure White: #FFFFFF

Purpose: neutrality, maximum contrast for notifications and ghost text.

Notifications (Foreground Bubbles)

Primary Grey Bubble: #F5F5F5

For less intense thoughts.

Highlight Blue Bubble: #0033A0 (Gador Blue)

For more impactful or emotional phrases.

Accent Teal Bubble: #00A99D

For variation and modernity.

Shadow: 0 2px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)

Corner Radius: 12‚Äì16px

Layout: stacked vertically, slightly overlapped, slight random tilt (¬±3¬∞).

Ghost Text (Background Layer)

Color: #1A1A1A at 10‚Äì15% opacity

Purpose: whispers, subconscious noise.

Movement: slow fade in/out, drifting horizontally.

Typography

Primary Font: Avenir Next (Regular / Bold)

Fallback: Helvetica

Size:

Notifications: 18‚Äì22px

Ghost text: 28‚Äì40px, low opacity

Color: #1A1A1A (dark grey/black) for text inside notifications.

Emoji Usage

Limited, as accents only (‚ö°üòüüì©).

Used sparingly inside some notification bubbles.

3. Animation & Motion
Notification Behavior

Entrance

Motion: slide up from bottom + fade in + slight scale-up (1.05 ‚Üí 1.0).

Duration: 0.4‚Äì0.6s.

Stagger: 0.2‚Äì0.3s random delay.

Idle State

Subtle floating: 2‚Äì6px vertical oscillation.

Tilt: ¬±2‚Äì3¬∞, slow drift.

Loop: infinite, slow sine ease.

Exit

Fade upward with blur.

Duration: 0.5‚Äì1s.

Keep max 4‚Äì5 notifications visible at once.

Ghost Text Behavior

Fade in ‚Üí linger (5‚Äì8s) ‚Üí fade out.

Random positioning (behind notifications).

Opacity: 0.1‚Äì0.15 (never distracts).

Motion: slow horizontal drift (20‚Äì40px across 10s).

4. Timeline (Scene Flow)

Opening Phase

One notification enters (centered).

Second notification joins after 0.5s.

Ghost text begins to fade in background.

Build-Up Phase

Notifications keep stacking (3‚Äì5 max).

Slight overlap and tilt create controlled chaos.

Ghost text increases in density.

Peak Phase

Notifications float, drift, overlap more.

Ghost text layered in background (like intrusive subconscious noise).

Resolution Phase (Optional)

Notifications fade out one by one.

Ghost text dissolves, leaving blank white screen.

5. Developer Implementation Notes

GSAP for notification motion (entrance, floating, exit).

Opacity + blur filters for ghost text fade in/out.

Layering order:

Base: white background.

Layer 2: ghost text (low opacity).

Layer 3: notifications (primary focus).

Performance: limit active notifications to ~5, ghost text to ~10 simultaneously.

‚úÖ This spec ensures:

Designers know exact colors, typography, and layout rules.

Developers know timing, easing, and motion specs (GSAP-friendly).

Client sees a clear reference to the mental health campaign style, but adapted to the interactive digital piece.

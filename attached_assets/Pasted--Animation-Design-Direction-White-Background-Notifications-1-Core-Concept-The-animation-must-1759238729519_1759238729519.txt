üìñ Animation & Design Direction ‚Äì White Background Notifications
1. Core Concept

The animation must simulate how intrusive thoughts feel like push notifications that keep popping up on your screen.

The white background ensures clarity and keeps the focus on the floating notifications.

The notifications should layer on top of each other, slightly messy, to represent the chaos of the mind.

The design must stay consistent with the mental health campaign visuals (clean typography, soft shadows, no overload of emojis).

2. Visual Language

Colors:

Notifications alternate between blue (highlight / anxiety peaks), light grey (background intrusive thoughts), and dark green/black (chat style, personal doubts).

Background words (like ‚Äúqu√© hacer‚Äù, ‚Äúinseguro‚Äù, ‚Äúinc√≥modo‚Äù) are in very light grey, almost invisible, to simulate constant mental noise.

Typography: Use Avenir Next / Helvetica, same as campaign assets. Strong, legible, modern.

Shadows & Depth: Each notification should feel like a card hovering, with soft shadows. This gives a sense of layers of thoughts.

3. Motion Principles

Entrance (pop-in)

Notifications should slide/fade in from below with a very short bounce, like a phone alert.

They should come in slightly staggered (not all at once) to create rhythm.

Idle State (subtle floating)

Once on screen, notifications float gently (2‚Äì6px up/down).

Some notifications tilt a few degrees to feel organic and chaotic.

This ‚Äúmicro-motion‚Äù gives life without overwhelming.

Exit (fade out)

Older notifications fade upward and blur slightly, like disappearing thoughts.

Always keep only 3‚Äì5 visible at once so it doesn‚Äôt feel cluttered.

Background words (ghost thoughts)

Random phrases softly appear and disappear in the background.

They are not interactive; they just add depth and atmosphere.

Their opacity stays below 10‚Äì15% so they never compete with the main messages.

4. Narrative Flow

Scene Start: Notifications appear slowly, one by one, simulating the first anxious thoughts.

Build-up: More notifications come in, overlapping and rotating slightly, giving the feeling of ‚Äúmental overload.‚Äù

Climax: The screen looks filled but still readable ‚Äî like a ‚Äúconstellation‚Äù of worries.

Resolution (optional for campaign video): Notifications fade out or transform into calmer, positive phrases, aligning with the health message.

5. Why This Works

The messy stacking mimics how anxiety feels: too many thoughts competing at once.

The limited palette & consistent style ensure it looks professional and not childish.

The GSAP-like micro-motions (subtle floating, staggered entry) make the animation feel alive and premium.

By using real phrases from the project (not random text), the animation connects emotionally with the viewer.

‚úÖ This explanation = your core design bible.
From here, devs can translate it into GSAP/After Effects, and designers can QA for pixel perfection.
